Writhe

Yep, I did another Silent Hill-esque program, though this time it was not planned. I had some time ago fallen in love with an example on p5.js's site that is this tentacle reaching for the mouse or a bouncing ball. My first idea was to use it to create seaweed flowing in the water, but when I tried to look for some code that could give the ball - that the tentacle reaches for - a random path to go by, one of those codes made its movement become very jagged, resulting in a jagged-moving tentacle. I thought it looked like some kind of monster, so I juiced it up with some Silent Hill soundtrack and a nasty filter on top - by using the sound and image codes that I have had success with in previous programs.
I do not understand all of the code I am using, but I found out how to change the tentacle's length and number of joints, how to change its color, the ball's starting position, and somewhat how it moves.

The three rule aspect confuses me a bit because I am not sure about what separates a rule from the rest of the code. What I think might be rules are; The ball must move in a random pattern, the tentacle must reach for the ball, but not tear itself apart or "uproot" itself.

My program expresses generativity by being an autonomous system. It lives and works on its own without any external manipulation. This results in unpredictability/randomness, which I think is also a key word in generative software. We understand that the tentacle moves, but we can never predict where it goes. Even if the music was originally put in for the mood's sake, I would also go as far as to say that the static is generative, what with the unpredictable noises.
